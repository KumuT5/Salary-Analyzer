# Salary-Analyzer
Python-based salary analysis project using data cleaning, visualization, and insights.
A Python-based salary analysis project focused on data cleaning, merging, exploratory data analysis, visualization, and insight generation using real-world survey datasets (2019 & 2021).
This project was built entirely in Jupyter Notebook (Anaconda Cloud) using step-by-step transformations and plots.

**⭐ Project Overview**
The goal of this project is to understand how different factors influence salary in the tech/data industry.

**Key questions explored:**
++ How does experience impact salary?
++ Which job titles earn the highest?
++ Does education level affect compensation?
++ How are salaries distributed overall?
++ Which countries pay the most?

The project combines two survey datasets, cleans them, fixes inconsistencies, and produces clear, professional visualizations.

⭐ Technologies Used:-
Python
Pandas
NumPy
Matplotlib
Seaborn
Jupyter Notebook (Anaconda Cloud)

⭐ Dataset Description
Two survey datasets were merged:
2019responses.csv
2021responses.csv

After cleaning, the final dataset contains columns as:
Salary (USD)
Years of Experience
Job Title
Education Level
Company Size
Work Hours
Remote Days
Employment Type
Country
Survey Year

⭐ Data Cleaning Steps

✔ Removed metadata rows
✔ Standardized column names
✔ Merged 2019 & 2021 datasets
✔ Converted salary to numeric
✔ Fixed invalid experience values (e.g., “2020”, “1997”)
✔ Removed outliers & duplicates
✔ Converted categoricals
✔ Filled missing values (median/mode)
✔ Sorted data by country/year
✔ Prepared final dataset stored in memory as dataset

**All transformations were performed directly inside the notebook.**

⭐ Visualizations
The following visualizations were created:

📌 1. Top 10 Countries by Salary **(Bar Plot)**

Shows which regions offer the highest compensation.

📌 2. Top Job Titles by Median Salary **(Column Chart)**

Reveals which roles are the highest-paying across the dataset.

📌 3. Salary vs Experience **(Scatter + Regression Line)**

A cleaned, corrected plot showing the relationship between experience and salary.

📌 4. Salary by Education Level **(Boxplot with custom blue palette)**
Visualizes how education influences pay.

📌 5. **Histograms** for Numeric Variables

Created for:
->Experience
->Work Hours
->Remote Days
->Team Size

📌 6. Modern Styled **Pie Chart**

Aesthetic pie chart showing education distribution.

**⭐ Insights**
Here are the key insights derived from the analysis:

🔹 Experience

Salary increases with experience, but not dramatically — experience alone does not guarantee higher pay.

🔹 Job Titles

One of the strongest predictors of salary.
Roles like Data Engineer, Senior Developer, and Database Architect dominate the top salary tier.

🔹 Education

Higher education levels generally correspond to higher salaries, but Bachelor’s holders show the widest variation.

🔹 Salary Distribution

Right-skewed — most salaries sit in the mid-range with a few extremely high earners pulling the average up.

🔹 Countries

Strong variation across regions, with US/Western Europe leading.

Overall:
“What job you do and where you work impact salary more than years of experience.”

**How to Run the Project**

>>Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/KumuT5/Salary-Analyzer.git
>>Open the Jupyter Notebook:
Salary_Analyser.ipynb
>>Run each cell in order — the notebook contains:
data loading
cleaning
merging
visualization
insights

**⭐ Future Improvements**

*Build an interactive dashboard (Streamlit / Power BI)
*Add machine learning salary prediction
*Create role clustering using NLP
*Add filters for country/year to the visualizations

**⭐ License**

This project is All Rights Reserved unless you choose to add a license later.
(You mentioned you do NOT want others using your code — so no open-source license is applied.)

**Final Note**

This project represents a full real-world data analysis workflow:

✔ cleaning
✔ merging
✔ fixing corrupt values
✔ plots
✔ insights
✔ GitHub documentation

Your repo now looks clean, real, and professional.
